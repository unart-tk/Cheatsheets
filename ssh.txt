SSH Cheatsheet
==============

_Shows how to generate and manage ssh keyfiles._

***


### Backup existing ssh setup

    mv ~/.ssh ~/.ssh{,.orig}
    mkdir ~/.ssh


### Generate a key

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 'bob@mail.com'

Options:
-t     type of key
-C     Comment

Note:
- Please give a good passphrase when asked.
- I like to define a unique name to the keyfile. During ssh-keygen, give the whole path '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa_mykey'
- Add the new file after the setup with `ssh-add`
