The gnupg vim plugin
---------------------

These are just a few notes after I lost a few hours of work by overwriting a secret file with 0.

There was a bit of vim rage involved. Plus I don't have the time to investigate were it went wrong. But when I look back to my - so far pleasant - past with this plugin, I come to the conclusion

    - Ecrypt with keyfile (`gpg -e -r 'julian' vstheworld.txt`) => GOOD

    - Encrypt with password (`gpg -c asciiporn.txt`) => BAD


Encrypt a file with a keyfile
------------------------------

It's more secure, vim doesn't ask you each time for the password. But when you loose the keyfile, you NEVER get to the data again.


    gpg -e -r <recipient> FILE

That means you have to know your recipients.

    gpg --list-secret-keys

    ...
    uid       santa
    ...

Ready go

    gpg -e -r 'santa' wishes.txt


Thats all.
